# Restaurant-Management-System

Going to a restaurant and navigating through the long menu, waiting for the waiter to place the order and then holding-up till the food gets ready is really hard and time consuming. It can make the customers frustrated and irritated for which a good restaurant should not compromise on the comfort of the customer. So, the goal of this management system is to deal with the customers efficiently. Most of the restaurants possess a single place for all their customers which is surely easier to manage but is not suitable for all kinds of gatherings. Keeping a record of the orders and bills of all the customers along with the priority ones and going through it manually is a tedious task plus it does not ensure correctness. With the help of software based mechanism, these problems can be minimized without compromising accuracy and precision. Keeping this in view, the project aims to create a system for a restaurant that allows the customers to place their order by choosing items from the displayed menu and wait till the food is ready. The order placed by the customer can be either dine-in or take way. The restaurant has multiple halls, each designed to allow specific meetings (formal, informal). The menu card includes different types of food items, e.g., Traditional, Chinese, Italian, etc. The restaurant keeps an open air arrangement for the ones willing to take barbeque. As soon as the customer finishes eating, he gets the bill and asked to pay. List of Main Features

   * The manager of the restaurant decides the items that can be added or removed from the menu card depending upon the customer’s response, he sets the prices of        the food items and decides the promotional events and discount schemes.
   * The restaurant also offers its customers membership cards that are to be renewed after one year. Having a membership card enables a customer to have special        privileges.
   * There are two halls for formal gatherings. One of them accommodates ceremonies and the other serves for official meetings. There are separate halls for family,      friends and business dining.
  *  Tables are allotted to customers according to the number of guests and waiter according to the number of customers he is already dealing.
  *  The record of all types of employees, e.g., manager, assistant managers, waiters, chefs and security guards is also preserved. Except the chefs and the              manager, all employees are allowed to be part-time workers.
  *  There are also many assistant managers who reports the manager about the requirements of the hall and organizes the ceremonies.
  *  After the dinner, bill is generated covering the full food details and on payment, exit card is handed to them.
  * If a customer tries to leave the restaurant without paying bill, the alarm beeps and the security guard hooks him up and looks for the exit card.
  * The customers are allowed to reserve a table or a hall for ceremonies on a particular date and time and if the customer has the bad history with reservations,       his reservation would not be processed.
  * When a customer gets in, his details are saved with the order he has placed. Whenever the same customer visits again, he’ll be displayed the menu showing the       items of his interested category at the top.
  * Customer can choose to complain against food or staff member and these complaints would be dealt effectively for improving the quality of the restaurant.
  * Take Away and Home Delivery options would also be provided to the customers.


This Project was developed in C++ using object oriented approach. QT Creator was used in order to implement GUI of the project. Besides implementation we also made sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, used cases, analysis and design class diagram. We also used design pattern in implementation of this project.
